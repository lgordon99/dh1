- The past it is a magic word
- Too beautiful to last,
- It looks back like a lovely face[^fn1]--
- Who can forget the past?
- There's music in its childhood
- That's known in every tongue,
- Like the music of the wildwood
- All chorus to the song.

- The happy dream, the joyous play,
- The life without a sigh,
- The beauty thoughts can ne'er portray,
- In those four letters lie;
- The painter's beauty-breathing arts,
- The poet's speaking pens,
- Can ne'er call back a thousand part
- Of what that word contains[^fn2]

- And fancy at its sweetest hour
- What e'er may come to pass
- Shall find that magic thrill no more--
- Time broke it like his glass.
- The sweetest joy, the fairest face,
- The treasure most preferred,
- Have left the honours of their place
- Locked in that silent word.[^fn3]
